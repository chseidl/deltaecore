   <description>
      Integration of DeltaEcore into FeatureIDE. The feature model
of FeatureIDE may be used to specify configuration options and
to define configurations. During variant derivation, the respective
information is automatically transformed to the DeltaEcore pendants
in order to employ the back end of DeltaEcore to manifest transformation-based
variability in arbitrary model-based languages.
