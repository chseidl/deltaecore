Notes: This has not been completed yet!

- Some implementations in delta modules still missing (see TODOs)
- Determine original state of NotCompartmentsAndRoles.decore before introduction of Player class


- fix ecore diagram of base variant some time

- what about order constraints with delta modules referencing elements in old package structure and the evolution delta modules moving elements
	- might be that I need "before" and "after" application order constraints to ensure that some delta modules are applied before the core move in RMLFeatureModel_2014_07_14.decore
	- create "bore" and " after AOCs:
		- extend meta model (only to delta modules)
		- extend delta sorter to add edges _if both delta modules are already present_ (declaring delta module and the one named in the AOC)

		
- NotCompartmentBehaviorAndNotCompartmentProperties.decore in 2014_07_14???
- Need more mappings/constraints instead of empty delta modules
- OnCompartments and NotOnCompartments in same configuration
- OnCompartments_2014_07_14 not selected
