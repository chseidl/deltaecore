(0) 16.11.2014
==============
- Initial Version


(1a) 17.11.2014
===============
(- FMandatoryCircle)
(- GDiamonds)
(- GTriangle)
- Resources introduced


(1b) 18.11.2014
===============
- Refined "Versions" feature to have child "Configurable"
  - Selecting "Configurable" implements versions as with Seidl et al. 2013
  - Deselecting "Configurable" implements versions as with Mitschke et al. 2008 (with just 2 attributes in the feature)
  - Constraints adapted to use "Configurable" where "Versions" was
- Added setInterface() to DeltaEcore (language)


(2) 19.11.2014
==============
- BindingTimes:
  - Added feature (was forgotten before)
- External added:
  - Allows referencing of features located in other feature models
  - Create SExternalFeatureReference
  - Add feature: SExternalFeatureReference --> SFeature
- FeatureModelingFamily modified:
  - Remove features : SGroup <>->* SFeature
  - Create SGroupArtifact interface
  - Make SGroupArtifact super class of SFeature
  - Add groupArtifacts: SGroup <>->* SGroupArtifact
  - Changed default implementation of SGroup.isOr() from "return (getMinCardinality() == 1 && getMaxCardinality() == getFeatures().size());" to "return (getMinCardinality() == 1 && getMaxCardinality() == getElements().size());"
  
  - Add SGroup.isAnd()
  - Add standard implementation for SGroup.isAnd()
- GroupVariationType modified:
  - <Requires FeatureModelingFamily_2014_11_19>
  - Add SGroupVariationType.AND
  - Add implementation for SGroup.isAnd() with explicit variation type
- Attributes modified:
  - Changed type of SAttributeValueAssignment.attributeValue from SAttribute to SAttributeValue (BUG)
  - Old version should no longer be selected (added constraint "!Attributes [="2014_11_16"]")


(3a) 20.11.2014
===============
- BindingTimes modified:
  - Changed literal of EEnumliteral SFeatureBindingTime.RUN_TIME to "RUN_TIME" (from "COMPILE_TIME", bug)
  - Old version should no longer be selected (added constraint "!BindingTimes [="2014_11_19"]")


(3b) 21.11.2014
===============
- Resources modified:
  - Changed SFeature.resources to 0..* (from 1..*) (bugfix/improvement)
  - Made ExternalResourceReference concrete (from abstract) (bugfix)
  - Added non-containment reference resource:EObject to ExternalResourceReference (bugfix)
  - Old version should no longer be selected (added constraint "!Resources [="2014_11_16"]")
- NotDomainTypeOrDiscrete.decore: added attribute rawValue:Eint to SIntegerValue (bugfix)
  - GTK: Hard to devise version from this as the original expression for mapping is "(Attributes && !DomainType) || Discrete"
    - Created versions for Attributes and Discrete
    - Adapted mapping expression to "(Attributes [>="2014_11_21"] && !DomainType) || Discrete [>="2014_11_21"]"
    - Old versions should no longer be selected (added constraint "!Attributes [="2014_11_19"] && !Discrete [>="2014_11_16"]")

(3c) 22.11.2014
===============
- not SEnumLiteral should be the SAttributeValue but a newly created class SEnumerationLiteralReference
  - create EClass SEnumerationLiteralReference (with reference to SEnumerationLiteral)
  - remove super type SAttributeValue from SEnumerationLiteral
  - remove super type SAttributeValue to SEnumerationLiteralReference

(4) 23.11.2014
==============
- added variability for constraints and their ConcreteSyntax
- TODO: when non-textual representation of constraints is requested, the concrete syntax file should not be included at all



TODOs
=====
- check default implementations of eOperations
- declared type for enumerations only later on
- evolution of SConfigurationArtifact with introduction of attributes and attribute value assignments
